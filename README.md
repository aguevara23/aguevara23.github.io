##### Summary

My web development portfolio website.

##### Description

My web development portfolio, with more recent work at the top of the projects section. I decided to use React so that I could create a few components that display all the project information from a data file. This way I can easily update my list of portfolio projects by adding a new item to the array of projects.

##### Technologies Used

- React (Create React App)
- React Router

##### Styling

- CSS Modules
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

##### Technical Features

- Hovering over a project thumbnail shows the icons of core technologies used.
- A custom Icon component that changes src file based on its props.
- A custom Image component that changes src file and styling based on its props.

##### Backlog

- Add animations throughout app.
- In the project details view, add a list of thumbnail images that users can hover over, which then changes the main project image.
