        <p>
          My name’s Alex. I’m a self-taught web developer from Nyack, New York.
          I started learning to code a couple of years ago through Code Academy
          and Free Code Camp. I then switched to Udemy, taking several courses
          for front end and full stack web development with JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work primarily on the front end with React as my library of choice.
          However, I have experience with full stack JavaScript, using Node.js,
          Express.js, and MongoDB for the backend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from coding, I enjoy photography, storytelling, writing,
          traveling, and learning languages. I also have an avid interest in
          virtual reality and can’t wait for the second generation of VR
          headsets. I’m also currently taking classes at The City College of New
          York.
